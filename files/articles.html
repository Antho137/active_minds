                            <p class="pt-2 p-3">Climate change is one of the serious problems to solve today in the world. Since some times, we assiste indifferently to many effects of climate change, such as increased temperatures, heavier precipitations at differents area of the globe. Today, no one can deny the evidence of climate change. As long as, decisions and actions will not be taken to find a solution, the danger will be permanent. The change on how to understand and to do things better is a pressing subject.</p>

                            <p class="pt-2 p-3">Solar energy is one of the way to deal with the environment's crisis. Instead of continuing to damage our habitat, let promote and improve a healhty relationship between humans and nature. Renewable energy contribue to reduce the excess of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the Earth's atmosphere and suits well as one of the solutions to the problem of the climate change the world is faced to. The shifting to the new energy systems is imperative.</p>

This opportunity for people's better live still remain a dream, mainly for countries strongly dependent to industrial nations. Yes, life equality chances is possible, as long as there is a strategy to implement it. Even, it is a long process, but it's worth to try than never. Life equality chances for all will be an evidence when a common interest will prevalece between nations.</p>

                            <p class="pt-2 p-3">The process of integrating nations and peoples into a larger community denominated "Global Society" is not evident today. Discrepancies that exist among different world's countries in several aspects seem to be a barrier. Globalization created new opportunities for international trade and investment but this didn't permit poor countries  to develop economically. Globalization has benefited more multinational corporations at the expense of common people.</p>

                            <p class="pt-2 p-3">When we are going somewhere, we must know the way. To get in the right way we must know the direction to follow. The evidence of today's crisis in the world affects all of us, and the life is becoming an evident frustation! Looking for solutions outside of us isn't the way, because we are the solution. To Experiment new horizons, it requires sacrifices and determination! Nowadays, if the life is threaten in the world, we are responsibles of that!</p>

                            <p class="pt-2 p-3">With stated purposes to maintain international peace and security, the United Nations (UN) was established after World War II on 1945 to prevent future world wars. Up now, UN actions trying to preserve peace has been ineffectives  considering many armed conflicts in different regions. Does the UN will be able to take significant actions against all kinds of violations that occur in the world? We hope that the UN will be more effective to promote prosperity and peace, as well as preserve them.</p>
